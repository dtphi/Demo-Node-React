##
Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.

While Facade decreases the overall complexity of the application, it also helps to move unwanted dependencies to one place.

##
Usage examples: The Facade pattern is commonly used in apps written in TypeScript. Itâ€™s especially handy when working with complex libraries and APIs.

Identification: Facade can be recognized in a class that has a simple interface, but delegates most of the work to other classes. Usually, facades manage the full life cycle of objects they use.

Conceptual Example

This example illustrates the structure of the Facade design pattern and focuses on the following questions:

What classes does it consist of?
What roles do these classes play?
In what way the elements of the pattern are related?
