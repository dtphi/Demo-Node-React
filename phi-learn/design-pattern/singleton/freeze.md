## freeze the instance

Let's export the Counter instance from the counter.js file. But before doing so, we should freeze the instance as well. The Object.freeze method makes sure that consuming code cannot modify the Singleton. Properties on the frozen instance cannot be added or modified, which reduces the risk of accidentally overwriting the values on the Singleton.

## Initialization Types of Singleton

Singleton class can be instantiated by two methods:
1. - Early initialization :
In this method, class is initialized whether it is to be used or not. The main advantage of this method is its simplicity. You initiate the class at the time of class loading. Its drawback is that class is always initialized whether it is being used or not.

2. - Lazy initialization :
In this method, class in initialized only when it is required. It can save you from instantiating the class when you donâ€™t need it. Generally, lazy initialization is used when we create a singleton class.

# Some major of them are:

1. - Hardware interface access: 
The use of singleton depends on the requirements. Singleton classes are also used to prevent concurrent access of class. Practically singleton can be used in case external hardware resource usage limitation required e.g. Hardware printers where the print spooler can be made a singleton to avoid multiple concurrent accesses and creating deadlock.

2. - Logger :
Singleton classes are used in log file generations. Log files are created by the logger class object. Suppose an application where the logging utility has to produce one log file based on the messages received from the users. If there is multiple client application using this logging utility class they might create multiple instances of this class and it can potentially cause issues during concurrent access to the same logger file. We can use the logger utility class as a singleton and provide a global point of reference so that each user can use this utility and no 2 users access it at the same time.

3. - Configuration File: 
This is another potential candidate for Singleton pattern because this has a performance benefit as it prevents multiple users to repeatedly access and read the configuration file or properties file. It creates a single instance of the configuration file which can be accessed by multiple calls concurrently as it will provide static config data loaded into in-memory objects. The application only reads from the configuration file for the first time and thereafter from second call onwards the client applications read the data from in-memory objects.

4. - Cache:
We can use the cache as a singleton object as it can have a global point of reference and for all future calls to the cache object the client application will use the in-memory object.
