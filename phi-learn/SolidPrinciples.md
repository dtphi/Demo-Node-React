# Solid Principles
## Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have only one job.

## Open-Closed Principle
Software entities (Classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension, not modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
A sub-class must be substitutable for its super-class

## Interface Segregation Principle
Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific. Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle
Dependency should be on abstractions not concretions: A. High-level modules should not depend upon low-level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions. B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
