JavaScript At Scale Code Examples
=================================

Here you'll find the instructions for getting
and running with the code examples for this book.

The first step is installing the node modules we'll
need. If you don't have nodejs installed, you'll need it.

https://nodejs.org/

Once nodejs installed on your system, you'll have an `npm`
command available. You'll need the `http-server` package
installed globally, by running the following command on the
command line: `npm install -g http-server`. Then, from within this
directory, run `npm install`.

This will create a new `node_modules` directory. This is
where the dependencies necessary for running the code
examples go.

The code examples are organized by chapter. The static
web server should be running so that we can load ES6 JavaScript
modules. So from withing this directory, on the command line,
run `http-server`.

Then in your browser, go to http://127.0.0.1:8080

From here, you can navigate through each chapter, and each code
example within. You can easily follow along with the code using
your favorite editor because the file structure is the same as
what you see in the browser.

Enjoy!
